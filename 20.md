**Problem Statement:**

**Function Signature:**
```javascript
/**
 * Express route to calculate the average age of all users in MongoDB
 * @param {Object} req - Express request object
 * @param {Object} res - Express response object
 */
function averageAgeOfUsers(req, res) {
  // Your implementation here
}
```

**Expected Output:**
- Return a JSON response with the calculated average age.

**Test Cases:**
